# Development Journey - Tech Blog Project

## Initial Analysis - January 28, 2025 20:52 (Paris Time)

### Requirements Analysis:
- Need a static site generator with markdown support
- Must be deployable with minimal effort
- SEO optimization out of the box
- No complex infrastructure
- Fast deployment through git push
- Modern, clean design

### Strategic Decision:
After analyzing the requirements, I'm going with **Hugo** as our static site generator for the following reasons:
1. Lightning fast build times
2. Excellent markdown support
3. Built-in SEO optimization
4. Can be hosted on GitHub Pages with automatic deployment
5. Rich theme ecosystem
6. Simple local development
7. No database needed

## Implementation Progress - January 28, 2025 21:20 (Paris Time)

### Current Session Goals:
1. 🎨 Create and add visual assets
   - Create a simple logo for the blog
   - Generate favicon set
   - Add profile image for the homepage
2. 🚀 Complete deployment setup
   - Fix GitHub Pages configuration
   - Verify successful deployment

### Completed Steps:
1. ✅ Installed Hugo via Homebrew
2. ✅ Created new Hugo site
3. ✅ Added PaperMod theme (clean, modern, SEO-optimized)
4. ✅ Configured `hugo.toml` with optimal settings
5. ✅ Created first blog post about AI Pair Programming
6. ✅ Tested site locally (confirmed working at http://localhost:1313/cursor-tech-blog/)
7. ✅ Created GitHub repository
8. ✅ Set up GitHub Actions workflow
9. ✅ Pushed initial commit

### Current Challenges:
1. 🔄 GitHub Actions deployment failing
   - Error: "Get Pages site failed. Please verify that the repository has Pages enabled"
   - Solution attempted: Updated workflow to use latest v4 actions
   - Next step: Need to properly configure GitHub Pages in repository settings

### Pending Steps:
1. Configure GitHub Pages settings:
   - Set source to "GitHub Actions"
   - Wait for first successful deployment

### Technical Decisions Made:
- **Theme**: Chose PaperMod for its modern design, fast loading times, and SEO features
- **Configuration**: Enabled all important SEO features in `hugo.toml`
- **Content Structure**: Using posts directory for blog articles
- **Date Format**: Using ISO 8601 for consistency
- **Deployment**: Using GitHub Actions for automated builds and deployment
- **Branch Strategy**: Main branch for content, gh-pages for deployment

The site will be live at: https://pierretsia.github.io/cursor-tech-blog/
