# Development Journey - Tech Blog Project

## Initial Analysis - January 28, 2025 20:52 (Paris Time)

### Requirements Analysis:
- Need a static site generator with markdown support
- Must be deployable with minimal effort
- SEO optimization out of the box
- No complex infrastructure
- Fast deployment through git push
- Modern, clean design

### Strategic Decision:
After analyzing the requirements, I'm going with **Hugo** as our static site generator for the following reasons:
1. Lightning fast build times
2. Excellent markdown support
3. Built-in SEO optimization
4. Can be hosted on GitHub Pages with automatic deployment
5. Rich theme ecosystem
6. Simple local development
7. No database needed

## Implementation Progress - January 28, 2025 21:00 (Paris Time)

### Completed Steps:
1. âœ… Installed Hugo via Homebrew
2. âœ… Created new Hugo site
3. âœ… Added PaperMod theme (clean, modern, SEO-optimized)
4. âœ… Configured `hugo.toml` with optimal settings
5. âœ… Created first blog post about AI Pair Programming
6. âœ… Tested site locally
7. âœ… Created GitHub repository
8. âœ… Set up GitHub Actions workflow
9. âœ… Pushed initial commit

### Final Steps Required:
1. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings:
   - Go to repository Settings > Pages
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: gh-pages (will be created by Actions)
2. Wait for GitHub Actions to complete the first deployment

### Technical Decisions Made:
- **Theme**: Chose PaperMod for its modern design, fast loading times, and SEO features
- **Configuration**: Enabled all important SEO features in `hugo.toml`
- **Content Structure**: Using posts directory for blog articles
- **Date Format**: Using ISO 8601 for consistency
- **Deployment**: Using GitHub Actions for automated builds and deployment
- **Branch Strategy**: Main branch for content, gh-pages for deployment

The site will be live at: https://pierretsia.github.io/cursor-tech-blog/

Time to completion: ~30 minutes from start to deployment! ðŸš€
