# Development Journey - Tech Blog Project

## Initial Analysis - January 28, 2025 20:52 (Paris Time)

### Requirements Analysis:
- Need a static site generator with markdown support
- Must be deployable with minimal effort
- SEO optimization out of the box
- No complex infrastructure
- Fast deployment through git push
- Modern, clean design

### Strategic Decision:
After analyzing the requirements, I'm going with **Hugo** as our static site generator for the following reasons:
1. Lightning fast build times
2. Excellent markdown support
3. Built-in SEO optimization
4. Can be hosted on GitHub Pages with automatic deployment
5. Rich theme ecosystem
6. Simple local development
7. No database needed

## Implementation Progress - January 28, 2025 21:00 (Paris Time)

### Completed Steps:
1. âœ… Installed Hugo via Homebrew
2. âœ… Created new Hugo site
3. âœ… Added PaperMod theme (clean, modern, SEO-optimized)
4. âœ… Configured `hugo.toml` with optimal settings
5. âœ… Created first blog post about AI Pair Programming

### Next Steps:
1. Test the site locally
2. Set up GitHub repository
3. Configure GitHub Pages
4. Set up GitHub Actions for automatic deployment

### Technical Decisions Made:
- **Theme**: Chose PaperMod for its modern design, fast loading times, and SEO features
- **Configuration**: Enabled all important SEO features in `hugo.toml`
- **Content Structure**: Using posts directory for blog articles
- **Date Format**: Using ISO 8601 for consistency
