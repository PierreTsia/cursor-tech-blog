# Development Journey - Tech Blog Project

## Initial Analysis - January 28, 2025 20:52 (Paris Time)

### Requirements Analysis:
- Need a static site generator with markdown support
- Must be deployable with minimal effort
- SEO optimization out of the box
- No complex infrastructure
- Fast deployment through git push
- Modern, clean design

### Strategic Decision:
After analyzing the requirements, I'm going with **Hugo** as our static site generator for the following reasons:
1. Lightning fast build times
2. Excellent markdown support
3. Built-in SEO optimization
4. Can be hosted on GitHub Pages with automatic deployment
5. Rich theme ecosystem
6. Simple local development
7. No database needed

1. 🎉 Site is live at https://pierretsia.github.io/cursor-tech-blog/
2. ✅ GitHub Pages deployment successful
3. ✅ Logo and basic structure in place

### Current Focus:
1. Blog post visibility
   - Need to check why the AI Pair Programming post isn't showing on homepage
2. Visual polish
   - Consider adding more visual elements
   - Ensure responsive design is working
3. Content organization
   - Verify tags and categories are working
   - Check navigation structure

### Technical Wins:

### Technical Decisions Made:
- **Theme**: Chose PaperMod for its modern design, fast loading times, and SEO features
