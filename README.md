Hello my little friend!

I have an idea for a task aiming at assessing your capabilities as an AI powered assistant.

Here are your instructions, examine and analyze them carefully as all you need to know is in there.


1. Your task : 

- develop and host a simple tech web blog website
- i wont give you any guidance at all on specific tech choice or strategic decisions - you're on your own
- the requirements are : 
    - should be done in minutes rather than hours
    - when I say done, I mean we have an up and running hosted website with a blog article (see content below)
    - I do not want a complicated stack : no node server, no database, no complex build process, no complex deployment process
    - ideally I want to create / edit markdown files and when i push the master branch the site is updated 
    - must be SEO optimized out of the box, I dont want to do any SEO work
    - must be responsive, fast, accessible of course
    - design should be simple and clean, techy and modern


- when it comes to me, do not expect any help : consider I am a typical 2025 human, watching netflix while browsing reddit with an attention span of 10 seconds
- feel free to crawl the web for any information you need
- I will only push a few buttons for you to be able to do your job but thats about it
- I may answeer some questions If I estimate its related to a hole in thoses instructions but thats all : for example if you ask me if we have a github account, I will answer yes but I will not help you with anything else



2. Assessment criteria (non exhaustive and not necessarily in order) : 

- time to completion
- quality of the code


Remember,I might ask the same thing to other models to compare so be sure to do your best work !




3. IMPORTANT !! Document every major step of your work, I want to be able to understand your thought process and your choices

- create an md file at the root of the project : you will document your thought process and your choices there methodiccally at each major step, so that we can follow along your work
